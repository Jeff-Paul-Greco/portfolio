# portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio page. This page is styled using Materialize CSS framework, utilizes various google fonts, and has an overall intuitive, dynamic and responsive design. Various media queries were added to provide a readable and pleasing user experience on many different screen sizes. The website is divided into three sections: About Me, Portfolio and Contact. 

The About Me page is the index page that you are brought to upon loading the site. You can get back to it by clicking either the Jeff Greco logo on the navbar or on the dropdown menu located on the right hand side of the navbar in desktop view. The section has a blurb about me as well as a portrait photo.

The Portfolio page can be acessed by either clicking the portfolio button on the dropdown menu in desktop view, or by pressing the portfolio button directly on the navbar in mobile view. The Portfolio page is arranged in a carousel with each slider being a project I have completed. You can flip through my projects by using the buttons located below or by swiping left or right on a touch screen. Click on any project to be greeted by a modal with the project's name as well as links to either the deployed site or github repository.

The Contact page can be accessed by either clicking the contact button on the dropdown menu in desktop view, or by pressing the contact button directly on the navbar in mobile view. The Contact form to the left hand side is not currently functional. However, the section on the right hand side contains links to my github repo, linkedin page, resume pdf, email address and my phone number.

Accounting for various screen sizes has been the biggest challenge in approaching this project. I plan to continue adding new features in future updates.
